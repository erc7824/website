# Quick Start

**[Nitrolite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@erc7824/nitrolite)** is our official SDK for creating state channel applications. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and types to simplify the development of high-performance blockchain applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with Nitrolite, ensure that you have:

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or later
- **Package Manager**: npm, yarn, or pnpm
- **Web3 Development Knowledge**: Basic understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts
- **Development Environment**: 
  - For frontend: React, Vue, or similar framework
  - For backend: Node.js environment
- **Ethereum Wallet**: MetaMask or another web3 provider for testing
- **Test Assets**: For test networks

## Installation

You can install Nitrolite using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

  ```bash
  npm install @erc7824/nitrolite
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

  ```bash
  yarn add @erc7824/nitrolite
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

  ```bash
  pnpm add @erc7824/nitrolite
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once installed, you can import Nitrolite into your project:

```javascript
// ES Modules
import { NitroliteClient } from '@erc7824/nitrolite';

// CommonJS
const { NitroliteClient } = require('@erc7824/nitrolite');
```


## Next steps

Channels follow a clear lifecycle that involves several key steps:

1. **[Client Initialization](initializing_client)**: Set up the client with your desired configuration
2. **[Deposit and Channel Creation](deposit_and_create_channel)**: Fund your channel and establish it with participants
3. **[ClearNode Connection](connect_to_the_clearnode)**: Connect to a ClearNode for off-chain messaging
4. **[Channel Asset Management](balances)**: Monitor and manage assets within your channels
5. **[Application Sessions](application_session)**: Create sessions to run specific applications
6. **[Session Closure](close_session)**: Properly close application sessions when finished
7. **[Resize Operations](resize_channel)**: Adjust channel capacity as needed
8. **Challenge Mechanism**: Handle disputes or unresponsive counterparties
9. **[Channel Closure](close_channel)**: Safely close channels with final state settlement
10. **[Withdrawal](withdrawal)**: Reclaim your funds from the custody contract

We recommend working through these guides in sequence to understand the complete channel workflow. Each guide builds on concepts from previous sections.

Start with the [Client Initialization](initializing_client) guide to begin your journey with Nitrolite state channels.
