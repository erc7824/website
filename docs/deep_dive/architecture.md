# Architecture Overview

Nitrolite's architecture represents a carefully balanced set of design decisions that prioritize performance, security, and usability while managing the inherent trade-offs in distributed systems.

## Architectural Philosophy

### Hybrid On-Chain/Off-Chain Design

Nitrolite implements a **three-layer separation of concerns** where each layer is optimized for its specific role:

- **Smart contracts** handle custody and dispute resolution
- **ClearNode** manages high-frequency off-chain operations
- **TypeScript SDK** provides developer-friendly abstractions

**Design Rationale**: This separation allows the system to achieve high throughput (1000+ TPS per channel) while maintaining blockchain-level security guarantees. By keeping most operations off-chain, users pay gas fees only twice: when opening and closing channels.

### Two-Party Channel Architecture

Rather than supporting arbitrary n-party channels, Nitrolite implements a **fixed Creator/Broker model**:

```solidity
uint256 constant PART_NUM = 2;
uint256 constant CLIENT_IDX = 0; // Channel creator
uint256 constant SERVER_IDX = 1; // Broker in clearnet context
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Complexity reduction**: Two-party channels eliminate exponential complexity growth seen in n-party protocols
- **Hub efficiency**: Brokers act as liquidity hubs, enabling users to interact with all other users through a single channel
- **UX optimization**: Users maintain one channel instead of managing multiple peer connections
- **Capital efficiency**: Liquidity is consolidated rather than fragmented across many channels

## Core Design Decisions

### Magic Number Protocol

Nitrolite uses explicit "magic numbers" to indicate state transition intentions:

```solidity
uint32 constant CHANOPEN = 7877;   // Funding state
uint32 constant CHANCLOSE = 7879;  // Closing state
uint32 constant CHANRESIZE = 7883; // Resize state
```

**Design Rationale**: This prevents accidental state transitions and provides clear semantic meaning. Instead of inferring intent from state changes, the protocol requires explicit declaration, improving safety and debuggability.

### Chain-Agnostic Signature Model

The protocol deliberately avoids EIP-191 message prefixing:

> "For signature verification, the stateHash is bare signed without EIP-191 since the protocol is intended to be chain-agnostic."

**Design Rationale**: This enables identical protocol logic across all EVM-compatible chains without modification, supporting the multi-chain vision where users can choose their preferred blockchain based on fees and speed.

### Double-Entry Ledger System

ClearNode implements traditional double-entry accounting for off-chain balance tracking:

```go
type Entry struct {
    AccountID   string
    Credit      decimal.Decimal
    Debit       decimal.Decimal
    // Credits always equal debits across the system
}
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Auditability**: Complete transaction history with immutable records
- **Consistency**: Mathematical guarantee that books balance
- **Compliance**: Follows established financial accounting practices
- **Precision**: Uses decimal arithmetic to avoid floating-point errors in financial calculations

## Technology Choice Rationale

### Go for ClearNode Backend

**Why Go over Node.js/Python/Rust?**
- **Concurrency model**: Goroutines efficiently handle multiple blockchain event listeners simultaneously
- **Memory efficiency**: Better resource usage for long-running services compared to Node.js
- **Crypto libraries**: Excellent native support for ECDSA and Ethereum integration
- **Operational simplicity**: Single binary deployment with built-in monitoring
- **Network performance**: Superior WebSocket handling for real-time messaging requirements

### TypeScript SDK Design

**Why TypeScript over pure JavaScript?**
- **Type safety**: Prevents runtime errors in financial applications
- **Developer experience**: Excellent IDE support and autocomplete
- **Viem integration**: Built on modern, well-maintained Ethereum libraries
- **Multi-framework support**: Works with React, Vue, Angular without framework lock-in

## Security Architecture

### Challenge-Response Dispute Resolution

Instead of requiring real-time monitoring, Nitrolite uses **optimistic execution** with challenge periods:

```solidity
function challenge(bytes32 channelId, State calldata candidate, State[] calldata proofs) external {
    // Economic security through time-locked disputes
    meta.challengeExpire = block.timestamp + meta.chan.challenge;
    meta.stage = ChannelStatus.DISPUTE;
}
```

**Design Rationale**: This provides economic security while allowing participants to be offline for extended periods. The system assumes good behavior but provides recourse through cryptographically verifiable challenges.

### Interface Segregation Pattern

The protocol separates concerns through focused interfaces:

```solidity
interface IChannel {    // Channel lifecycle
interface IDeposit {    // Token custody
interface IAdjudicator { // Application logic
interface IComparable { // State ordering
```

**Design Rationale**: This modularity allows applications to implement only the interfaces they need, reducing attack surface and enabling compositability.

## Virtual Application Architecture

### Session Keys and Delegation

Nitrolite supports "session keys" where channel creators can be different from fund providers:

```solidity
// NOTE: it is allowed for depositor (and wallet) to be different from channel creator (participant)
// This enables logic of "session keys" where a user can create a channel on behalf of another account
```

**Design Rationale**: This separation improves UX by allowing high-frequency signing without exposing main wallet private keys. Applications can use hot wallets for state updates while keeping funds secured by cold storage.

### Quorum-Based Virtual Ledger Channels

Applications create isolated accounting contexts within channels:

```go
// Virtual applications require quorum approval for state transitions
if totalWeight < int64(appSession.Quorum) {
    return fmt.Errorf("quorum not met: %d / %d", totalWeight, appSession.Quorum)
}
```

**Design Rationale**: This enables complex multi-party applications (games, voting, auctions) while maintaining the simplicity of two-party channels. Virtual applications handle business logic while the underlying channel provides security guarantees.

## Multi-Chain Strategy

### Asset Management Philosophy

Each token-chain combination is treated as a distinct asset:

```go
type Asset struct {
    Token    string `gorm:"column:token;primaryKey"`
    ChainID  uint32 `gorm:"column:chain_id;primaryKey"`
    Symbol   string `gorm:"column:symbol;not null"`
    Decimals uint8  `gorm:"column:decimals;not null"`
}
```

**Design Rationale**: This prevents cross-chain confusion and enables proper decimal handling. Users explicitly choose their blockchain based on preferences for fees, speed, and finality.

### Independent Chain Operation

Each blockchain maintains separate custody contracts and event listeners:

```go
// Concurrent event listeners for multiple chains
for name, network := range config.networks {
    go client.ListenEvents(context.Background())
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Chain independence reduces systemic risk and allows the protocol to continue operating even if individual blockchains experience issues.

## Trade-off Analysis

### Centralization vs. User Experience

**Trade-off**: Uses broker hub model instead of fully peer-to-peer architecture
- **Cost**: Introduces potential central points of failure
- **Benefit**: Dramatically improves UX (one channel vs. many), enables instant liquidity
- **Mitigation**: Users retain custody through on-chain contracts; multiple brokers can compete

### Flexibility vs. Complexity

**Trade-off**: Fixed 2-party channels instead of n-party support
- **Cost**: Cannot directly support complex multi-party protocols
- **Benefit**: Eliminates exponential complexity growth, easier security analysis
- **Mitigation**: Virtual ledger channels enable arbitrary multi-party applications

### Performance vs. Decentralization

**Trade-off**: Go backend service instead of pure smart contract execution
- **Cost**: Requires trust in ClearNode operators
- **Benefit**: Enables complex business logic, high throughput, better UX
- **Mitigation**: Challenge/response mechanism ensures trustless dispute resolution

## Protocol Innovation

### Array-Based RPC Messages

Uses deterministic array serialization instead of object-based JSON:

```json
{
  "req": [REQUEST_ID, METHOD, [PARAMETERS], TIMESTAMP],
  "sig": ["SIGNATURE"]
}
```

**Design Rationale**: Arrays provide deterministic serialization order, ensuring consistent signature generation across different JSON implementations. This prevents signature verification failures due to property ordering differences.

### Intent-Based State Validation

Different state types follow different validation rules:

```go
type Intent uint8
const (
    IntentOPERATE    Intent = 0  // Normal application states
    IntentINITIALIZE Intent = 1  // Channel funding states
    IntentRESIZE     Intent = 2  // Capacity adjustment states
    IntentFINALIZE   Intent = 3  // Channel closing states
)
```

**Design Rationale**: This provides type safety and enables protocol evolution. New intent types can be added without breaking existing validation logic, supporting future protocol upgrades.

This architecture represents a pragmatic approach to state channels that prioritizes practical usability while maintaining cryptographic security guarantees. Each design decision reflects careful consideration of the trade-offs inherent in distributed financial systems.
